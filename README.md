# Explanation about "fund" input file

The input data related with the fund information will be read by the program from the "fund.xlsx" file. 
For the sensitivity analysis purpose, there are several other "fund*.xlsx" files.
"fund_70%.xlsx" means that each investment plan data for each container port and investment year is multiplied by 70% from its original value ("fund_100%.xlsx").
To use the file, please revise the filename into "fund.xlsx" first.


Any discussion matters and research collaboration ideas can be sent by email to ivanksinggih@gmail.com.
